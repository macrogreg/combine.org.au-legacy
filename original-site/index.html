	<h1>ICT for Life Sciences Forum Students Chapter - COMBINE </h1>
	<p>We are a community of (mainly research) students in Melbourne and other parts of Victoria who are doing research or are otherwise interested in computational biology, bioinformatics or any other area of computational and mathematical life sciences. Being under the umbrella of <a href="ictlsf-web.html">ICT for Life Sciences Forum</a> we are an autonomous student chapter seeking to connect interested students and young researchers.</p>
	<p>We do this primarily by organising a series of social  events and seminar &amp; discussion events where interested students and young researchers can meet to find out about each other's research, to find people interested in their work, to make contacts for collaboration and co-operation, and of course - to have fun!</p>
	<p>The social events usually take place in a quiet pub or bar on a weekday evening, where people can socialise in a relaxed and engaging atmosphere, away from the fluorescent lights of the offices.<br>
	  The seminars are usually followed by an informal discussion session with wine and cheese. We are trying to create a good mix of seminar topics and presenters. While we plan to have regular talks by leading Australian and international researchers from all areas of computational biology, we also want to have regular meetings where our members get a chance to present their own work and and to receive feedback from others. </p>

	<h2>Staying in touch </h2>
	<p>This current website is a placeholder. When the ICT for Life Sciences Forum is officially launched and it's primary website becomes active, our website will be integrated with the main Forum site. We plan a number of features to help people connect, including a forum and a number of other things. Until then, this temporary website will be used to introduce ourselves and to inform about our events.</p>
	<p>In addition we run a <a href="http://au.groups.yahoo.com/group/combine-group/" target="_blank">mailing list on Yahoo</a> (it will be replaced by our forum in future). We strongly recommend that our members and those who are interested in coming to our events subscribe to that list as this is currently our primary form of talking to each other. Subscription to the list requires approval, but this is merely to prevent spam. You can register using your Yahoo ID or any other email address. For details please visit <a href="http://au.groups.yahoo.com/group/combine-group/" target="_blank">http://au.groups.yahoo.com/group/combine-group/</a>.</p>
	<div class="top-line">[ <a href="#" title="Top of Page">ToP</a> ]</div>
	<h2>Events</h2>
	<p>You can find information about our <a href="#FutureEvents">past</a> and <a href="#FutureEvents">future</a> events here. As most of our events include free drinks and food, we need to know the number of people attending up-front. For this, we require everyone who plans to attend to register (which is of course - free). Currently, registrations are by emailing to <img class="in-text-image" alt="Registration email is displayed as an image to prevent spam. Do not confuse it with the similar, but different group mailing list email address." src="images/NoSpam-RegistrationEmail.gif">. Please make sure that your intent to register and the specific event are clear from the subject line. </p>
